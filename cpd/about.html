          Massachusetts College of Art and Design was the country&#8217;s first independent public college of art and design, founded in 1873. The college&#8217;s professional baccalaureate and graduate programs prepare students to participate in the creative economy as fine artists, designers, and art educators, and to engage in the well being of their society. As a national leader in visual art and design education, the college influences contemporary culture through the accomplishments of its alumni and the creative activities of its faculty and staff. MassArt&#8217;s Graphic Design program is well-known for preparing its students to enter the profession at the highest levels.
