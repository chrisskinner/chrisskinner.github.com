    <h1>THE GOOSE WHICH WAS MOST CONFUSED</h1>
    <h2>By Billy Bob-Thorton Billy</h2>
    <p>On its way to Las Vegas this llama named Stephen was destined to become a star. 
    	Yet on the way the truck hit a bump and our friend Stephen was tossed into nearby park.
    	This park had a lake with Geese in it.</p>

    <p>The first thing Stephen did was step in Goose poop. He realized at some point that there was no logical way out of the park. 
    	Although before his journey he had dreamt of the attention he wold obtain from being a celebrity, he forced himself to see this community of 
    	Geese as his new family. It took a long time getting used to the environment and understanding the language. Goose culture is ten times more complicated than the language and most can't speak it without a beak.
    	Stephen did it though especially since he was a natural in languages. It took Stephen 16 years to completely blend in with the Geese. By that time he had completely forgot his past as Llama. 
    	Stephen will live on a duck... forever.</p>
