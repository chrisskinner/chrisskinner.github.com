    <h1>THE GOOSE WHICH WAS MOST CONFUSED</h1>
    <h2>By Billy Bob-Thorton Billy</h2>
    <p>On its way to Las Vegas this llama named Stephen was destined to become a star. 
    	Yet on the way the truck hit a bump and our friend Stephen was tossed into nearby park.
    	This park had a lake with Geese in it.</p>

    <p>The first thing Stephen did was step in Goose poop. He realized at some point that there was no logical way out of the park. 
    	Although before his journey he had dreamt of the attention he wold obtain from being a celebrity, he forced himself to see this community of 
    	Geese as his new family. It took a long time getting used to the environment and understanding the language. Goose culture is ten times more complicated than the language and most can't speak it without a beak.
    	Stephen did it though especially since he was a natural in languages. It took Stephen 16 years to completely blend in with the Geese. By that time he had completely forgot his past as Llama. 
    	Stephen will live on a duck... forever.</p>

    <h1>Cactus Carl Ate Too Many Pickles</h1>
    <h2>By Fron Droshure</h2>
    <p>Shredding various licks on his jazz cactus guitar, Carl the Llama hit a fret prick while practicing scales.
    This for a fusionistrah such as Carl was a common rookie mistake. The practice is the most intense. His finger burned. The only thing which
    would ease the pain was pickle juice. Mad pickles were obtained.  </p>

    <p>The pickle juice was not working at this time. "Holy shit bro I gotta shred I can't believe I am being held back from shredding," thought carl.
    As you can see in the picture this llama did not play around in the world of top shred jazz dude. the only thing which seemed most reasonable as to both ease the pain and heal the wound faster was to eat the pickles.
    This was not a practice advised by most professionals, but Carl thought he was on to some major scientific breakthrough with this gut impulse. He ate the pickles.He ate all the pickles.
    He then took on the form of a pickle-like life creature with fur and shit. It was the most depressing day ever. He now lives in Verona New Jersey behind a pizza restaurant where he has access to an endless supply of Dr. Pepper.</p>
