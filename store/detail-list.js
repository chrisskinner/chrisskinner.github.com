From the L.A. underground bass club that began the movement we've witnessed the emergence of SoCal's super-producer collective Team Supreme, yet the creme de la creme on showcase purrs ever so smoothly like the coolest cat. Big heaters and introspective drifters meet speakers and subwoofers through the crafted production details of samples, classic electronic drum programming, and vintage keys. Great Dane on the beat never sounded as sweet as now. Worldwide release set for February 25th on Alpha Pup Records.",

MAST communicates to the core with a contemporary, electronic review of song-writing through a jazz composer's lens of unorthodox transcendence. Invoking the spirit of monumental Japanese painter Katsushika Hokusai, Conley pronounces an aesthetic theme to the surrounding emotive course of the album at-large bound by the serene and magical landscapes sometimes confusing, always intriguing.---The Los Angeles electronic forefront of Alpha Pup Records speaks to every walk of life on the \"OMNI\" vibration plane, and it is not alone that the MAST vessel sets sail the maiden voyage. Assists from soul-navigating vocal gestures of Anna Wise (Sonnymoon, Kendrick Lamar), way-out raps from Brainfeeder/Warp's Jeremiah Jae, lullaby serenades from Low Leaf, and the long time partner / tourmate RYAT (Brainfeeder) attribute to the intricate album weaving of all things. All companions considered, it is Conley's solo sense of devotion to experimental process that guides us through the perfect flux that is MAST.",
